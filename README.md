I'd love to collaborate on projects. Here are my interests although I am open to other areas:
- Embedded Systems
- Robotics/Navigation (Motion control, simulation, teleoperation, surgical/prosthetic applications, )
- 3D modeling/Printing (Prototyping)
- Imaging (Machine/computer vision, pose estimation, segmentation, edge detection, image registration, 3D Reconstruction)
- Signal Processing (Acquiring, preprocessing/filtering, feature extraction for pattern recognition)
- Research (Literature research, data analysis and modeling, etc.)

Will be adding Projects with skill tags
